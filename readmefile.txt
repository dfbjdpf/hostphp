If the value of the html input tag is passed to PHP and the pass / fail is compared,
the PHP input tag can be automatically filled and logged in. 
The operation is simple: first open the <hash-pass-test-test.html> of the html file,
then enter email, password, and tap submit. If eamil and password are together, 
the PHP file <index.php> will be automatically opened and the eamil and password will 
be auto-filled. 
Finally, tap Login to complete the login. However, if one or two of Email and Password 
are wrong, the input field of the login page of the HTML page will be initialized and 
you will need to re-enter it.
