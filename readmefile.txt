If the value of the html input tag is passed to PHP and the pass or fail is compared,
the PHP input tag can be automatically filled and logged in. <.html> and <.php> files 
must always be opened on a web server that support PHP, such as Apache.
The operation is simple, first open the <hash-pass-test-test.html> of the html file,
then enter email, password, and tap submit. If email and password are together, the PHP 
file <index.php> will be automatically opened and the email and password will be 
auto-filled. You can also compare hashing paths with input values. Finally, tap Login to 
complete the login. However, if one or two of Email and Password are wrong, the input 
field of the login page of the HTML page will be initialized and you will need to 
re-enter it. original input password is "admin" and email address is "admin@admin.com.
We cannot guarantee the security of your password. This is because email addresses and 
passwords are already built in by setting.
Password hashing and authentication are possible, but it is suitable for simple access 
authorization that allows you to access the target page after authentication.
Error comments display is hidden, however, it can be selected from #error_reporting(0); 
error reporting hidden or error_reporting(E_ALL); show.
